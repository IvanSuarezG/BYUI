                <h2>Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>

                <p class="info_1">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long 
                    ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell 
                    so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the 
                    United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, 
                    and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                <p class="info_2">Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable 
                    river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient
                    indian ruins accessible only by river.
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are 
                    technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. 
                    However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
