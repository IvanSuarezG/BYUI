            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p> This is a web page for a new company I created a couple of years ago. My objective is to give to know 
                about our services in eco-tourism. Allow all people to know the privilege we have to live in a country 
                that offers us the most amazing landscapes and helps us to travel through them.
                So, the web page will share information about the services we offer in rafting to couples, families, 
                companies, and general groups in the different rivers of the country.
                The web page, allows the customers to select a plan of rafting, pay through the digital bill, 
                select the date of the travel, and give a suggestion box to receive opinions allowing us to 
                improve our service.
            </p>
                <h3>Audience</h3>
                <p> Families, couples, companies, educational institutions, and groups of friends. They are groups looking
                    for plans to share, have fun, and make memorable memories that unite families, co-workers, and school 
                    colleagues. Romantic activities for couples who are starting a courtship, celebrating a wedding anniversary, 
                    or who are about to get engaged.
                    They will be able to access our services from any mobile device. The website will publicize our channels on 
                    YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook.
