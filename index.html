    <h1>About me</h1>

    <h2> Iván Suárez</h2>
    <p>I'm from Colombia. I'm 27 years old and I got married 5 yeras ago. We have one daughter;
        her name is Ana Sofia.  I had the blessing to know the church  through my wife. She shared 
        the gospel with me when we were in High school. I serve a mission in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
        I am an industrial automation and Robotics technologist and I am working in the food industry.
        I love playing soccer, often I use my time watching movies, listen to mucis at a high volume, and 
        dance with my wife and daughter. We love all gender of music. but I specially like "merengue" and "salsa"
        because is the funniest to dance it.

    <p> The opportunity to study at BYU-Idaho allowed me to gain new insights and set new goals according to the 
        highest purpose. For example, obtaining a job allows me to spend more time at home  and share with my daughter
        carrying her to school. Another purpose is to put together development web and automation or robotics 
        so that I create a company that offers industry solutions.
    </p>
    <p> One of my favorite scripture is in 1 Nephi 17:51 which quotes "And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has 
        wrought so many miracles among the children of men. How is it that  he cannot instruct me. that I should build a  
        ship?" Help me to reflect when I'm trying to do new thing or don't achieve something. The Lord can show me the form I can do,
        line upon line, precept upon precept, and finally I achieved</p>
